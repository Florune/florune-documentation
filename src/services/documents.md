# Document & Verification Layer

## Introduction

The **Document & Verification Layer** enables **secure, tamper-proof, and verifiable document management** within the Florune ecosystem. It empowers individuals, businesses, and enterprises to **create, verify, and timestamp digital documents** on-chain, ensuring authenticity, integrity, and selective sharing.

This layer is ideal for:

* **Legal and compliance documentation**
* **Intellectual property proof and timestamping**
* **Smart-contract-linked document verification**
* **Auditable, verifiable credentials for enterprise workflows**

All services in this layer leverage **on-chain proof mechanisms** and decentralized storage to guarantee **security, transparency, and user control**.

## Layer Overview

| Layer Name              | Description                                                                                    | Services                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Document & Verification | Provides secure, verifiable, and tamper-proof document management and on-chain proof services. | Verifiable Documents, Document Registry |

**Key Objectives of the Layer:**

* Ensure **document authenticity and integrity**
* Enable **revocable and selective disclosure**
* Provide **cost-effective proof of document existence**
* Integrate documents with **smart contract agreements**

## Services in Document & Verification Layer

### 1. Verifiable Documents

**Purpose:**
Create secure, wallet-first documents that are **tamper-proof, revocable, and blockchain-backed**, with optional linking to smart contracts for automated enforcement.

**Key Features:**

* **Revocable** and **contract-linkable** documents
* Stored locally or in decentralized storage
* On-chain **proof of authenticity**
* Supports **selective disclosure** for privacy
* Example deployment: **9 Rune per document**

**How It Works:**

1. User creates a document and signs it with their wallet.
2. Document metadata and proof are stored on-chain; content can remain off-chain.
3. Document can be linked to contracts (e.g., pledge agreements) for automated verification.
4. Selective disclosure allows sharing only specific portions of the document.

**Use Case Example:**

* A company issues a compliance certificate to a vendor. The certificate is verifiable on-chain, and the vendor can selectively share proof of compliance without exposing full content.

**Benefits:**

* **Tamper-proof and secure** – Blockchain ensures integrity
* **Privacy-preserving** – Selective disclosure protects sensitive information
* **Contract integration** – Links directly to escrow or pledge contracts for automated verification
* **Revocability** – Documents can be revoked if needed

### 2. Document Registry

**Purpose:**
Provide **low-cost, on-chain proof of document existence** for timestamping, authorship claims, and IP verification.

**Key Features:**

* **Lightweight and public** registry
* Cost-effective solution compared to full verifiable document deployment
* Immutable on-chain proof without storing full document content
* Pay-per-use with native chain tokens

**How It Works:**

1. User registers the document’s hash on-chain.
2. The blockchain records the timestamp and ownership proof.
3. Anyone can verify the document’s existence and authenticity without accessing the full document.

**Use Case Example:**

* An author timestamps a manuscript’s hash to prove authorship. Later, if needed, they can show the timestamped hash to assert intellectual property rights.

**Benefits:**

* **Cost-effective** – Minimal on-chain storage fees
* **Public verification** – Anyone can verify existence and timestamp
* **Lightweight** – Ideal for large-scale or frequent document verification
* **Immutable proof** – On-chain records cannot be tampered with

## Layer Benefits Summary

| Service              | Key Advantages                                                       |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Verifiable Documents | Tamper-proof, revocable, selective disclosure, smart contract linked |
| Document Registry    | Lightweight, cost-effective, immutable proof of document existence   |

**Overall Layer Benefits:**

1. **Trustworthy Documents** – On-chain verification ensures authenticity.
2. **Privacy Control** – Selective disclosure keeps sensitive data secure.
3. **Contract Integration** – Documents can trigger or validate smart contracts.
4. **Cost Efficiency** – Public registry reduces overhead for proofs.
5. **Auditability** – Immutable on-chain records support compliance and legal needs.

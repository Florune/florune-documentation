# Flarion Token (FLR)

The **Flarion Token (FLR)** is a **non-financial, ERC-20 utility token** that functions as the key to access **Elysium Protocol**’s premium services. Unlike typical blockchain tokens, FLR is **not designed for trading or speculation**. Instead, it serves purely as a **limited-access credential**, ensuring that only authenticated users can access high-tier features within the Florune ecosystem.

FLR is issued in **limited supply** and is available **by invitation only**. Holding a Flarion Token designates the user as an **Elysian Account**, granting privileges such as access to advanced smart contract tools, the Pledge Contract system, the Verifiable Document Service, and the Rune execution suite.

The token provides **transferable access**: ownership of FLR directly correlates with Elysian Account privileges. When a token is transferred to another wallet, the new owner immediately receives full access rights, ensuring a **flexible and user-sovereign access model**. Importantly, FLR is not automatically consumed for payments. Users must **explicitly approve its use** for any transaction or service fee within Elysium, giving them **absolute control over their assets**.

Through FLR, the Florune ecosystem ensures a **secure, controlled, and high-value user experience**, where access to the most sophisticated services is **token-gated and permissioned**, rather than open to public or speculative trading.

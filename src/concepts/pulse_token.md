# Pulse Token

**Pulse (PULSE)** is the **execution token** within the SafePulse Elysium ecosystem, used exclusively for performing **premium on-chain operations**. It powers **high-security actions** such as executing Pledge Contracts, processing Verifiable Documents, and other Elysium services. Unlike traditional tokens, Pulse is **non-tradable** and **confined to internal platform use**, ensuring that its value is functional rather than financial.

PULSE acts as a **transactional asset**, providing a secure mechanism to perform critical operations while maintaining **data integrity, cryptographic assurance, and tamper-proof execution**. Access to Pulse-powered services is limited to **ElysianPulse Token holders**, ensuring that only verified users can engage in high-value interactions.

By separating **access credentials (ELYPS)** from **execution capabilities (PULSE)**, SafePulse achieves a robust **dual-token model**. This design provides **maximum user sovereignty**, enabling individuals to control both **who can access services** and **how their operations are executed**, all without sacrificing security or trustless automation. PULSE ensures that **premium transactions are authenticated, secure, and auditable**, providing a foundation for high-stakes, non-custodial operations.

## Service Structure Overview

Contract Foundry’s services can be grouped into three **main layers**:

1. **Payment & Agreement Layer** – Escrows and Pledge Contracts
2. **Document & Verification Layer** – Verifiable Documents, Document Registry
3. **Identity Layer** – Decentralized Identity (DID), Verifiable Credentials
4. **Content Access Layer** – Asset Paywall

Each layer interacts with smart contracts onchain, while maintaining **user control and transparency**.

---

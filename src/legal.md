# Legal Information

### Privacy and Data Protection

Florune is committed to respecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your data. We operate under strict principles of data minimalism: we **do not collect, store, or process sensitive personal information** such as names, government IDs, private keys, or biometric data.

Authentication is facilitated through trusted third-party services (such as Firebase Authentication), which may store minimal data like your email address. Florune itself **does not access or store this information**. All identity keys and credentials are created and stored locally on your device, and Florune has no access to these cryptographic materials.

### User Responsibilities

Users are responsible for securely managing their own cryptographic keys and credentials. If keys are lost or deleted, they cannot be recovered by Florune or any other party. We advise users to maintain proper backups and take necessary precautions to protect their digital assets.

### Escrow and Dispute Resolution

Florune offers escrow services to facilitate secure and trustless transactions. However, the platform **does not mediate disputes** between parties. In case of disagreements, contract-related actions such as fund withdrawals or rollback are disabled until all involved parties reach a consensus.

### Prohibited Uses

Use of the platform for illegal activities, including the distribution of unlawful or inappropriate content via asset paywalls, is strictly prohibited. Users are encouraged to report any violations promptly.

### Age Restrictions

Florune is designed for users aged 22 years and older. We do not knowingly collect data from individuals below this age.

### Updates and Amendments

Our policies and terms may evolve to reflect technological, regulatory, or operational changes. Any updates will be communicated clearly, and continued use of Florune implies acceptance of the revised terms.

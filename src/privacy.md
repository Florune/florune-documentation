# **1. Introduction**

Florune (“Florune”, “the Platform”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that you maintain full control over your data.
Florune is designed with **data minimalism**, **local-first identity**, and **non-custodial architecture** as core principles.

This Privacy Policy explains how Florune handles information, what is (and is not) collected, and your rights and responsibilities as a user.

# **3. Local Device Control of Identity and Keys**

All cryptographic materials—including identity keys, DID keys, private keys, credential keys, and signing keys—are generated and stored **exclusively on your device**.

Florune:

* does **not** access your keys
* does **not** store or back up keys

---

# **4. No Cloud Backups & No Cloud Recovery**

Florune does **not** provide:

* cloud backup
* cloud key storage
* SRP-based backup
* server-side identity storage

All recovery is performed **locally by you** using your own passphrase or recovery materials.

---

# **5. No Traditional Authentication Services**

Florune does **not** use or rely on:

* OAuth
* email/password authentication
* phone number verification
* Firebase Authentication
* centralized login systems
* third-party identity providers

Authentication and identity generation occur entirely **on-device** and are **self-sovereign**.

---

# **6. Optional Diagnostic Analytics**

Florune may collect **non-personal diagnostic data** solely to improve:

* stability
* performance
* security
* crash detection

This data:

* is **anonymous**
* contains **no identity or personal information**
* cannot be used to track or identify users
* can be **disabled at any time** in the settings

Diagnostic analytics may include device type, error logs, and crash traces—only for performance improvement.

---

# **7. No Tracking Technologies**

Florune does **not** use:

* cookies
* web beacons
* fingerprinting
* targeted advertising identifiers
* cross-site tracking
* behavioral analytics

No data is sold, shared, or monetized.

---

# **8. Third-Party Integrations**

When interacting with:

* identity providers
* blockchain RPC 
* Event loggers
* Error trackers

these integrations are:

* **optional**
* **user-initiated**
* **separate from Florune’s systems**
* governed by their **own privacy policies**

Florune does not control or store data from third-party services.

---

# **9. Escrow and Smart Contract Interactions**

Escrow operations and smart contract interactions may appear on public ledgers.
By design:

* transactions are irreversible
* blockchain records are public by default
* Florune cannot delete or alter blockchain data
* Florune cannot interfere with contract state

Users must ensure they understand the public and immutable nature of blockchain systems.

---

# **10. Content Restrictions & User Responsibility**

Users must ensure that their usage of Florune:

* complies with laws applicable to their own jurisdiction
* does not involve illegal, abusive, harmful, or exploitative content

Your activity on Florune remains private and local to your device.

---

# **13. Security Measures**

Florune uses:

* decentralized architectures
* secure cryptographic standards

However, no digital system is perfectly secure.

Users must:

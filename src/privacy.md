The Platform is designed with:

* **Data minimalism**

This Privacy Policy explains how Florune handles information, what is (and is not) collected, and your responsibilities as a user.

Florune collects **no personal information whatsoever**.

We do **not** collect, store, or process:

## **3. Local Device Control of Identity and Keys**

All cryptographic materials—including identity keys, DID keys, private keys, credential keys, and signing keys—are generated and stored **exclusively on your device**.

Florune:

* Does **not** access, store, back up, or transmit your keys
* Does **not** retain credential-related information

You are solely responsible for securing your keys, recovery phrases, and devices.
If keys are lost, Florune **cannot** recover them, reset them, or restore access.

---

## **4. No Cloud Backups & No Cloud Recovery**

Florune does **not** provide:

* Cloud backup or cloud key storage
* SRP-based backups
* Server-side identity storage
* Remote account restoration

All recovery is performed **locally by the user** using their own passphrase or recovery materials.

---

## **5. No Traditional Authentication Services**

Florune does **not** use or rely on:

* OAuth, email/password, phone verification

Florune may collect **non-personal diagnostic data** solely to improve:

* Stability
* Performance
* Security
* Crash detection

This data:

* Is **anonymous** and cannot identify users
* Contains **no personal or behavioral information**
* Can be **disabled at any time** in settings

Analytics may include device type, error logs, and crash traces—only for performance improvement.

---

## **7. No Tracking Technologies**

Florune does **not** use:

* Cookies, web beacons, or fingerprinting
* Targeted advertising identifiers
* Cross-site tracking or behavioral analytics

No data is sold, shared, or monetized.

---

## **8. Third-Party Integrations**

Interactions with third-party services (e.g., blockchain RPCs, event loggers, error trackers) are:

* **Optional** and user-initiated
* **Separate from Florune systems**
* Governed by the **third-party’s privacy policies**

Florune does **not** control or store data from third-party services.

---

## **9. Escrow and Smart Contract Interactions**

Escrow operations and smart contract interactions may appear on **public blockchains**.

* Transactions are **irreversible**
* Blockchain records are **public by default**
* Florune **cannot delete or alter blockchain data**
* Users must understand the **immutable nature of blockchain systems**

**Smart Contract Upgrades:**

* Florune may release updates or improvements
* Users may **choose whether or not to adopt updates**, at their own discretion
* The Platform provides **no guarantees** regarding performance, compatibility, or outcomes of upgraded contracts

---

## **10. Intellectual Property & Platform Ownership**

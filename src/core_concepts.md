# Core Concepts

Understanding Florune begins with a few key concepts. These principles define how the platform works and why it’s different from traditional systems.

## Smart Contract-as-a-Service (SCaaS)

Florune provides **Smart Contract-as-a-Service** — meaning you don’t need to code or deploy contracts manually.
Instead, you interact through the **Florune Wallet**, which abstracts away the complexity.

* **Automated**: Escrows, pledges, and verifications run without intermediaries.
* **Trustless**: Smart contracts enforce rules transparently onchain.
* **Accessible**: Anyone can deploy contracts with a few clicks, no technical expertise required.

## Non-Custodial Architecture

Traditional platforms hold custody of funds and data. Florune does not.

* You control your **funds, private keys, and documents**.
* No intermediaries can freeze, censor, or tamper with your assets.
* Agreements are **self-executing** and cannot be altered by third parties.

This ensures maximum **sovereignty and security** for users.

---

## Decentralized Identity (DID)

Florune implements **W3C-compliant Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**.
A DID is a portable, self-sovereign identity that you fully control.

* No central authority or platform owns your identity.
* DIDs can be used to prove who you are, without exposing unnecessary personal details.
* Works seamlessly with verifiable credentials.

## Verifiable Credentials (VCs)

**Verifiable Credentials** allow you to prove facts about yourself, your business, or your documents.

* Based on **W3C VC v2.0 standards**.
* Stored locally in your wallet (“wallet-first”), not on central servers.
* Can be **selectively disclosed** (you share only what’s needed, not everything).
* Tamper-proof, revocable, and portable across platforms.

Example: A freelancer can prove skill certification to a client without sharing their entire identity.

---

## Hybrid Storage

Florune supports both **decentralized and centralized storage** for documents.

* **Decentralized Options**: IPFS, Arweave.
* **Centralized Options**: Standard cloud or self-hosted storage.
* **Onchain Proofs**: Regardless of storage choice, proofs (hashes) are stored onchain for tamper-resistance.

This hybrid model ensures flexibility for users with different security or compliance needs.

---

## CFGT Token

Florune uses **CFGT**, an internal utility token, to fuel the system.

* **Non-tradable**: It cannot be speculated on; used only within the ecosystem.
* **Anti-spam**: Prevents fraudulent or unlimited contract creation.
* **Fair Access**: Required for deploying contracts like pledge agreements or verifiable documents.

---

## Why These Concepts Matter

Together, these building blocks create a system that is:

* **Trustless** – no intermediaries required.
* **Censorship-resistant** – no central authority can block access.
* **User-controlled** – assets, identity, and data remain with the user.
* **Borderless** – available globally, without banking or regulatory barriers.

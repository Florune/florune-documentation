# Token & Economy

The Florune ecosystem utilizes a **multi-layered token and fee system** designed to support trustless, non-custodial operations while maintaining fair access and network security.

This section explains the **Rune utility token, transaction fees, and revenue model**.

## Rune Utility Token

Florune uses **Rune** as an internal utility token to deploy certain types of contracts and services within the ecosystem.

### Key Characteristics:

* **Non-tradable:** Rune cannot be exchanged on external markets; it functions solely as a fuel token.
* **Network Security:** Prevents spamming and unauthorized contract deployment.
* **Access Control:** Required for deploying creatable contracts such as Pledge Contracts and Verifiable Documents.
* **Distribution:** Rune is allocated to users through predefined mechanisms (testnet faucets, mainnet issuance protocols).

### Usage Examples:

* Deploying a **Pledge Contract**: 33 Rune
* Deploying a **Verifiable Document**: 9 Rune

> ### Access Notice
>
> **Only Flarion token holders can buy Rune token.**
>
> **Eligibility:** Hold ≥ 1 Flarion token in a connected wallet.
> **How to participate:** Connect your wallet → Verify Flarion balance → Purchase Rune.
>
> *If you don't hold Flarion tokens yet, acquire them on supported exchanges or via the Flarion contract before attempting to buy Rune.*

## Fee Model

Florune combines **transaction-based fees** and Rune token usage to maintain sustainability:

| Service             | Fee Structure                   | Payment Method     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Escrow              | Flat deposit + 1% withdrawal    | Native chain token |
| Pledge Contract     | One-time creation fee (33 Rune) | Rune token         |
| Verifiable Document | Paid per deployment (9 Rune)    | Rune token         |
| Document Registry   | Low-cost pay-per-use            | Native chain token |
| Asset Paywall       | Transaction-based per access    | Native chain token |

### Notes:

* Pay-per-use fees apply to non-creatable contracts and public services.
* Rune is **required only for creatable contracts** to prevent misuse and secure the network.
* Subscription plans for enterprises provide predictable access for frequent contract deployment.

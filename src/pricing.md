# Token & Economy

The Florune ecosystem utilizes a **multi-layered token and fee system** designed to support trustless, non-custodial operations while maintaining fair access and network security.

This section explains the **CFGT utility token, transaction fees, and revenue model**.

## CFGT Utility Token

Florune uses **CFGT** as an internal utility token to deploy certain types of contracts and services within the ecosystem.

### Key Characteristics:

* **Non-tradable:** CFGT cannot be exchanged on external markets; it functions solely as a fuel token.
* **Network Security:** Prevents spamming and unauthorized contract deployment.
* **Access Control:** Required for deploying creatable contracts such as Pledge Contracts and Verifiable Documents.
* **Distribution:** CFGT is allocated to users through predefined mechanisms (testnet faucets, mainnet issuance protocols).

### Usage Examples:

* Deploying a **Pledge Contract**: 33 CFGT
* Deploying a **Verifiable Document**: 9 CFGT

## Fee Model

Florune combines **transaction-based fees** and CFGT token usage to maintain sustainability:

| Service             | Fee Structure                   | Payment Method     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Escrow              | Flat deposit + 1% withdrawal    | Native chain token |
| Pledge Contract     | One-time creation fee (33 CFGT) | CFGT token         |
| Verifiable Document | Paid per deployment (9 CFGT)    | CFGT token         |
| Document Registry   | Low-cost pay-per-use            | Native chain token |
| Asset Paywall       | Transaction-based per access    | Native chain token |

### Notes:

* Pay-per-use fees apply to non-creatable contracts and public services.
* CFGT is **required only for creatable contracts** to prevent misuse and secure the network.
* Subscription plans for enterprises provide predictable access for frequent contract deployment.

## Revenue Streams

Florune generates revenue through three main channels:

1. **Pay-As-You-Go**

   * Ideal for individuals and small businesses.

2. **Internal Utility Token (CFGT)**

   * Non-tradable token used as fuel for deployable contracts.
   * Ensures fair usage and prevents tampering.

3. **Subscription Plans**

   * Targeted at enterprises and high-volume users.
   * Covers creatable contracts and recurring usage.
   * Provides predictable revenue while maintaining trustless architecture.

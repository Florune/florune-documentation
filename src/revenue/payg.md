# Pay-As-You-Go Model

## **Overview**

The Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) model is designed for individual users and small teams who need flexible access to SafePulse without subscriptions.

Users pay only for what they use, using **native chain tokens** (ETH, POL, etc.).

It is the simplest and most accessible model for casual usage.

# Execution Asset

## **Overview**

SafePulse’s tokenomics are intentionally designed to avoid speculation and instead strengthen the integrity, security, and usability of the platform.
The ecosystem revolves around **PULSE**, a non-tradable internal utility token used exclusively to deploy certain types of smart contracts.

PULSE is not a currency, not a tradable asset, and not a revenue instrument.
It is a **functional fuel** that powers creatable agreements across the SafePulse network.

## **Purpose of PULSE**

PULSE exists to guarantee:

* **Fair access to contract creation**
* **Spam resistance**
* **Decentralized execution integrity**
* **Resource accountability** in contract deployment
* **A stable, predictable unit of work** inside SafePulse

By tying contract creation to an internal, fixed-supply token, SafePulse avoids volatility and ensures that the cost of deploying agreements stays stable across time and market cycles.

## **Where PULSE Is Used**

PULSE is required for deploying all **creatable contracts**, including:

* **Pledge Contracts**
* **Verifiable Document Contracts**

These contracts form the backbone of enterprise workflows, compliance systems, and automated agreements inside SafePulse.

---

## **Access to PULSE**

PULSE is **exclusive to Flarion holders**.
This creates a premium access layer for users who need:

* High-volume contract creation
* Enterprise-grade workflows
* Long-term, predictable operational scaling

It also ensures responsible use, preventing contract spamming and maintaining network health.

## **Design Principles**

### **1. Non-Tradeable, Utility-Only**

PULSE cannot be traded or sold on public markets.
This eliminates speculation and ensures token utility remains stable and predictable.

### **2. Anti-Spam and Cost Control**

Contract creation consumes PULSE, ensuring users deploy only meaningful agreements.

### **3. Predictable Economics**

PULSE is supplied to Flarion holders and via subscription rewards, giving users a structured, clear cost model for repeated deployments.

SafePulse’s ecosystem tokens built for functionality and real value as an execution asset, not hype.
PULSE powers the system with predictable, transparent, and fair access to smart contract creation—ensuring SafePulse remains sustainable, scalable, and trustless.

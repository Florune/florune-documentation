# Execution Asset

## **Overview**

Florune’s tokenomics are intentionally designed to avoid speculation and instead strengthen the integrity, security, and usability of the platform.
The ecosystem revolves around **RUNE**, a non-tradable internal utility token used exclusively to deploy certain types of smart contracts.

RUNE is not a currency, not a tradable asset, and not a revenue instrument.
It is a **functional fuel** that powers creatable agreements across the Florune network.

## **Purpose of RUNE**

RUNE exists to guarantee:

* **Fair access to contract creation**
* **Spam resistance**
* **Decentralized execution integrity**
* **Resource accountability** in contract deployment
* **A stable, predictable unit of work** inside Florune

By tying contract creation to an internal, fixed-supply token, Florune avoids volatility and ensures that the cost of deploying agreements stays stable across time and market cycles.

---

## **Where RUNE Is Used**

RUNE is required for deploying all **creatable contracts**, including:

* **Pledge Contracts**
* **Verifiable Document Contracts**

These contracts form the backbone of enterprise workflows, compliance systems, and automated agreements inside Florune.

---

## **Access to RUNE**

RUNE is **exclusive to Flarion holders**.
This creates a premium access layer for users who need:

* High-volume contract creation
* Enterprise-grade workflows
* Long-term, predictable operational scaling

It also ensures responsible use, preventing contract spamming and maintaining network health.

## **Design Principles**

### **1. Non-Tradeable, Utility-Only**

RUNE cannot be traded or sold on public markets.
This eliminates speculation and ensures token utility remains stable and predictable.

### **2. Anti-Spam and Cost Control**

Contract creation consumes RUNE, ensuring users deploy only meaningful agreements.

### **3. Predictable Economics**

RUNE is supplied to Flarion holders and via subscription rewards, giving users a structured, clear cost model for repeated deployments.

---

## **Summary**

Florune’s ecosystem tokens built for functionality and real value as an execution asset, not hype.
RUNE powers the system with predictable, transparent, and fair access to smart contract creation—ensuring Florune remains sustainable, scalable, and trustless.
